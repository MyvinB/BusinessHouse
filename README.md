# BusinessHouse

This was a project given to me the basic idea 
here is you need to implement solid principles and maintain a clean code

Basically it is a low level design question.
The aim of the question 
1) Test if candidate is maintaining reusable code and follows solid principle.
2) Code with test driven approach however not done the same since I had the basic idea.
3) If a developer could understand his or her code (USE COMMENTS and stuff like @param to make things clear)

Best of luck...
